   This is the quiz application _Trivia Timeline_ (Video-Game Edition). A 20 question quiz with questions rangeing from the 1980s right through to the late 2010s. i wanted to create a fun immersive experince with some aspects of video games and merge them with a tv game show quiz.   
   _Trivia Timeline_ can be played by anybody, although a knowledge of video games would certainly be an advantage, it is by no means neccesary.
   _Trivia Timeline_ could be used as an entertainment tool as part of a larger website. it could be expanded itself with new questions added.
   New versions could also be released under the same name but with a difrent edition title.

## **User Experience (UX)**

     - As a user i want information about how the quiz works to be available before starting.
     - As a user i want to see clearly how many questions i have answered correctly.
     - As a user i want clear feedback about correct or incorrect answers.
     - As a user i want to feel immersion while playing.
     - As a user i want to be able to exit the quiz at any point and return to the main menu.

   * **Dev Goals**
     - As a Developer i want to grab the users attention from the start.
     - As a Developer i want to create a feeling of immersion for the user.
     - As a Developer i want to maintain the users attention for the duration of the quiz.

* ## **Design**
    * **Color Scheme**
       - The Main colours for the quiz page were partially taken from the game screen background image, I then used the colours to create a gradient effect and applied this to the question container.  
       - The same process was used for the landing page to set the background for the buttons.

    
         ![image of color scheme](/assests/readme/images/canva-color.png)
       - The grey gradient effect buttons and the off white border go well with the page background and the other  
         colours used.
       - Nearly all text is an off white colour as it pairs well with the overall colour scheme and is easy to read.
    * **Typography**
        - _Orbitron_ with a fall back of _sans-serif_ was used for all buttons apart from the answer options. This font has a very cool
          and modern feel to it. It fits well with the video game theme of the quiz.
        
        - _Changa_ with a fall back of _sans-serif_ was used for nearly all text areas, this is because not only does it have a gaming look to it
          it is also easier to read than _Orbitron_ and has the option of lower font weights to increase readability. 

        - _Goldman_ with a fall back of cursive is used exclusively for the 2 central display elements. i wanted to give the user some extra variety
          when looking at the display. At large sizes this font looks modern and stylsh and overall adds to the user experience.

    * **Imagery**
        - The Landing page image was chosen to show the user the theme of the content of the quiz, the focus of the image is around the edges
          so as not to distract from the buttons in the center.
        - The Game page background was chosen to offer some visual appeal, however i wanted it to be fairly simple as far as images go in order
          for it not to cuase any distracton to the user or cause issues with readabilty from the display elements.

    * **Audio**
        - The main theme tune for the quiz was chosen for creating atmosphere, the music is light with a slight bit of tension.
          The purpose is to add another level of immersion to the user while playing.
        - The Correct and Incorrect sounds were chosen to indidcate to the user on an audio level if they answered the question correctly
          or incorrectly. I wanted something that would be noticed but not to overpowering that it would eventually become an irritation.
        - Light sounds play at certain points in the game to grab the users attention. These are again used to add more immersion to the user
          and to draw their attention to something that may be happening in the quiz.
